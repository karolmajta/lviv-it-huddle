      Based on the previous example you should be able to draw a single reindeer
      and make him move vertically (up) when some button on keyboard is pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and make him fast (faster then the santa) - the story says Rudolph is
      as fast as a lightning, that's why Santa uses him instead of a jet :)
      You can start with a template below.
    </p>
    <pre>
      var canvasWidth;
      var canvasHeight;
      var rudolphX;
      var rudolphY;
      var rudolphVelocity = 0;

      function drawReindeer(reindeerX, reindeerY) {
        // this is where you draw your reindeer as usual
      }

      function setup() {
        var parent = document.getElementById('game-container');
        canvasWidth = parent.clientWidth;
        canvasHeight = parent.clientHeight;
        var canvas = createCanvas(canvasWidth, canvasHeight);
        canvas.parent('game-container');
        rudolphX = canvasWidth/2;
        rudolphY = canvasHeight/2;
      }

      function draw()
      {
          background(255, 255, 255);
          noStroke();

          // make sure to draw rudolph based on where he is now.
          // his position is stored in boxes "rudolphX" and "rudolphY"

          // also make sure that rudolph actually moves! this means, that
          // you have to fiddle with "rudolphVelocity" box (variable)
          // make sure you mind the direction - this can get a bit tricky :)
      }

      function keyPressed() {
        // make rudolph fly when user pressed some key on keyboard
      }

      function keyReleased() {
        // and make him stop when user released some key
      }

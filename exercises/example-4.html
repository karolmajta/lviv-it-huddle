      Variables are like "boxes" where you can store numbers, text and "stuff"
      in general. In this example we will make our santa move by using variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example below we define 5 variables. We will focus on
      "santaX", "santaY", and "santaVelocity". When we create these "boxes"
      (variables), boxes "santaX" and "santaY" are empty, we put "0" to box
      named "santaVelocity".
    </p>
    <p>
      "setup" is a function that is called once, when the game starts (when
      you reload the page) - you can ignore most of it, but focus on last two
      lines. It puts things into "santaX" and "santaY" boxes. It says, that
      box "santaX" should contain "canvasWidth/2" (half the width of screen)
      and "santaY" should contain "canvasHeight/2". After setup is called:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>santaX</strong> contains a number that is half the width of screen</li>
      <li><strong>santaY</strong> contains a number that is half the height of screen</li>
      <li><strong>santaVelocity</strong> contains 0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      What does this mean? It means that Santa will be in the center of the screen.
      And that he doesn't move (he has 0 velocity).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's focus on "keyPressed" and "keyReleased" functions. They are also
      like "stamps" but instead of drawing stuff they do stuff. When? "keyPressed"
      does some stuff every time a key is pressed down on the keyboard, and
      "keyReleased" is does something every time key is released. So in key pressed
      we put 2 into "santaVelocity" box (this means he's now moving!), and every
      time a key is released we put 0 into this box (this means he's resting again).
    </p>
    <p>
      Last piece of the puzzle is the last line of "draw" function. It may seem
      strange at first: <code>santaX = santaX + santaVelocity</code> doesn't make
      sense (in terms of math), right? But actually it means, "look into the value"
      of box "santaX", look into the "value of "santaVelocity", and add them up
      (<code>... = santaX + santaVelocity</code>) and put them back in "santaX"
      box (<code>santaX = ...</code>). So, every time the draw function is called
      (and it's called often!) it will fiddle with "santaX" boxes, so our santa
      may be in slightly different place when "draw" runs again.
    </p>

      var canvasHeight;

          // here we update content of our "boxes" (variables), so that it changes
          // over time

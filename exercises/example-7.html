      Usually in games we deal with many things. One superhero fights many
      villains, one care races agains many others etc. Up till now we only learned
      how to deal with single things (santa). Let's say santa has to go through
      a forest that has many trees. How do we represent this? I've told you
      that variables (boxes) can contain many different things like text, numbers
      or "stuff". Well, it turns out that "stuff" can be something called
      <strong>array</strong>. Array is a list of many things (like you can make
      a list of students in a class or a list of groceries).
    </p>
    <p>
      To put an array of "stuff" into the box we just do
      <pre>
        var mybox = [1, 2, 3];
      </pre>
      This puts a list of numbers (1, 2, 3) into a box called "mybox".
      It turns out, that it's often more convenient to put more complex stuff
      on a list (i.e. when shopping you would like to put all items with their
      prices on a list). We can do that!
      <pre>
        var shopping = [{name: "carrot", price: 20}, {name: "beer", price: 25}]
      </pre>
      This makes a list of something we call objects (you don't have to care about
      it), it's important that each of items on a list has it's price and it's
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nice thing about lists, is that we can handle all of their contents at once
      (if you go shopping you don't buy carrots, and beer), you just buy everything
      on a list, right? That's how you do it:
      <pre>
        for (var i=0; i&lt;shopping.lenght; i = i+1) {
          buy(shopping[i]);
        }
      </pre>
      So without further ado, let's put our Santa in a forest :)
